# Initial Concepts 

* Link to refer the go-openai: https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai 

* Try and build a Golang clone of whisperwizard.com 
* So we create a Golang function/program that takes in a users voice 
* Then the voice will be converted into text 
* After that we send that text as a Chatgpt input 
* Finally the Chatgpt returns a text response to the user. 

## First Focus 
* Use OpenAI Whisper to do the speech to text function 

## Second Focus 
* Take the text from Whisper and use it on OpenAI Chatgpt3.5 

## Last Focus for now 
* Create a GUI format, and a chat log so that the user can have a interactive experience.
